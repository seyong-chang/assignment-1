5. "ls -al" is the command used to show all files in a directory, including hidden ones.

6. "ls current_directory non_current_directory" #passes command ls through a path to display the files of another directory in addition to our current working directory.

7. In bash, the rm command is used to delete files and folders. It is dangerous, because there is not undo/"undelete" option, so careless use of it can lead to removing sensitive system files, causing system instability. One scenario with unintended consequences might be when accidentally typing the wrong command or forgetting what a specific rm command does. For example, accidentally using -rf /(root) will delete files recursively, starting from the root directory, which can be disasterous.
