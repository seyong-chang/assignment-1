ls -al is the command used to show all files in a directory, including hidden ones.

ls current_directory non_current_directory #pass the path through command ls

In bash, the rm command is used to delete files and folders. It is dangerous, because there is not undo/"undelete" option, so careless use of it can lead to removing sensitive system files, causing system instability. One scenario with unintended consequences might be when accidentally typing the wrong command or forgetting what a specific rm command does. For example, accidentally using -rf /(root) will delete files recursively, starting from the root directory, which can be disasterous. 

cd /c/Users/seyon/Documents/GitHub/assignment-1/answers
mkdir results #creates new working directory called "results"
cd /c/Users/seyon/Documents/GitHub/assignment-1/answers/results
pwd #to check current working directory
mkdir sh my_script.sh #creates new scripts file called "my_script"
nano my_script

git add my_script
git status
git commit -m "added my_script file"
git status

git pull origin main
git push -u origin main #will push local repo changes to remote repo

$ cd /c/Users/seyon/Documents/GitHub/assignment-1/assignment-1-main-main/data #1 line navigation from answers directory to data directory
